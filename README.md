Allows you to downgrade installed apps.

Note: Server is slow right now but it will get faster automatically one day when I switch back to my own.

2. Download AppStore++ [here](https://github.com/CokePokes/AppStorePlus-TrollStore/releases/download/release/AppStore++_TrollStore_v1.ipa) from your mobile safari.
3. Open Files app and "Open in" Trollstore. & Done.

Enjoy.
